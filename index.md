*See full project ideas [here](https://github.com/hrwgc/nyc/blob/gh-pages/_posts/project.md)*

*Note:This project is a continuation of previous work, see [here](http://wiki.datawithoutborders.cc/index.php?title=Project:Current_events:NYC_DD:NYCLU) for work done at Data Dive NYC*

*It was also inspired by Naomi Robbin's work with [crime and stop and frisk data](http://www.forbes.com/sites/naomirobbins/2012/03/23/visualizing-stop-and-frisk-and-murder-rates-in-new-york-city/).*

![Aggregate 2011 Stops]({{ASSET_PATH}}/themes/core/css/img/aggregate2011.png)

 - Shows all stops in 2011, suffers from density problem. Showing close to 700,000 stops on any map makes it difficult to see density and patterns.

![density map]({{ASSET_PATH}}/themes/core/css/img/density.png)

- This map, with greater opacity and a much smaller marker size, shows the hotspots for stops. 

![Choropleth of crime data]({{ASSET_PATH}}/themes/core/css/img/choropleth.png)

- This map shows some of the precinct-level crime data I have been cleaning. The precinct colors show numbers of felonious assaults for 07/2010, with the bluer precincts denoting higher number of assaults.
- Note: this map should not be compared with the density map preceding it, as they are from different time periods. The points are from all of 2011, whereas this map shows the number of assaults as of July 2010.
